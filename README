PROJECT EULER SOLUTIONS FILES

Documents my foray into mathematical programming in python.

It's mildly embarassing to go back and see completely unpythonic code at the beginning,
and even more embarassing to see the recent completely unpythonic code.

I feel it is in the spirit of Project Euler to have answers available on Github; if
you do decided to use my answers to "cheat" and answer questions that you don't
actually know how to answer, the only person that you've really cheated is yourself.

Most everything is in Python, and some of the commenting is pretty bad.
